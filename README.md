This app allows a user to create, read, update, and remove dogs from the Doggone database.

Primary users are a shelter administrator who have the ability to make changes to the database, and potential adopters who can just view the available dogs.

The database was populated using Mockaroo (https://mockaroo.com/), with images and breeds coming from the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) 

Roadmap: 
12/30/2019 - Version 1.0 released
